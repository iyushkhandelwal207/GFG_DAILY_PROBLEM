# GFG_DAILY_PROBLEM

This repository contains my daily solutions to algorithmic / coding problems, mainly from **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)** and similar platforms.  
Each folder represents a single problem, usually containing the solution file(s) and sometimes additional notes.

- Each directory is named after a problem.
- Inside each folder, you’ll find the solution implementation (in Java, C++, or Python).
- Problems are solved daily and pushed here for learning and practice.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse the folder of the problem you’re interested in.
2. Read the code solution and problem description (refer GFG if needed).
3. Run the code locally:
   - For **Java**: `javac FileName.java && java FileName`
   - For **C++**: `g++ file.cpp -o file && ./file`
   - For **Python**: `python file.py`
4. Test with your own inputs.

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

- If you want to contribute:
  - Add solutions in a language not yet covered.
  - Improve time/space complexity.
  - Add comments and explanation.
- Please follow clean coding style and proper folder naming.

## 📝 Example

In folder **`Design max min queue`**, you’ll find a solution implementing a queue with `O(1)` getMin/getMax operations.  
You can open the file, read the implementation, and run it to test.

## 📌 Notes

- Problems are mostly from **GeeksforGeeks Daily Problems**.
- Code is organized for easy navigation and reference.
- All solutions are tested with sample cases.
